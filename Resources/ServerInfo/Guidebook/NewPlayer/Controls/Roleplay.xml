# Roleplaying
Ultimately we are expecting all players to be playing a character that exists seperate from themselves in the space of the server. Characters that have depth and personalities beyond just being a blank homunculus.

But what is Roleplaying?  Well, based off a wikipedia description.

A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game, or abbreviated as RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting.
Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development.
Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.

We have a set of expectations that we expect all characters to be built within, and while failure to do so may not cause you to be banned outright it will certainly make fitting a character in much harder.

## RP Interest System

We have a system in place to encourage roleplaying.  Whenever your character takes an Acting Action (Says, Whispers, Emotes, Subtles) you gain points towards a half-hourly interest check. When that check runs you gain a small percent of interest on your bank account.

This system is designed to reward players who are proactive about the world around them, who react with emotion and with characterization. It has a process in place to stop reward gained from spamming as well, so best to not try and cheese it.



## Characterization

What is characterization?  Or, how I learned to stop thinking like a lego minifig and pretend to be a person.


## Emotes and Subtles

We have made changes to the emotes and subtle system, they are listed here.
